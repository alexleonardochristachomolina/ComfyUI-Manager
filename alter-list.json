With this extension, various settings can be used to implement prompt processing methods similar to A1111. As this feature is also integrated into ComfyUI Cutoff, please download the Cutoff extension if you plan to use it in conjunction with Cutoff."

       "description": "The extension provides an unsampler that reverses the sampling process, allowing for a function similar to img2img alt to be implemented. Furthermore, ComfyUI uses CPU's Random instead of GPU's Random for better reproducibility compared to A1111. This extension provides the ability to use GPU's Random for Latent Noise. However, since GPU's Random may vary depending on the GPU model, reproducibility on different devices cannot be guaranteed."
